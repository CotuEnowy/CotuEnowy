- 👋 Hi, I’m @CotuEnowy.
- 👀 I’m interested in game dev and simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about science, and physics such as string theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that peak my interest given I have the free time.
- 📫 How to reach me: add me on discord @xxalchemistxx
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: Black holes are called event horizons, they have a infinitly small point in the center called a singularity which is also equally infinitly dense (heavy) so it causes extreme gravity.
